            Dear Participants,
        </p>
        <p class="jspsych-display-element" align=left>
            Thank you for your interest! In this study, you will be asked to answer simple questions about 
            how likely things are.
            The study is expected to take about 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <p class="jspsych-display-element" align=left>
            You are being asked to participate in a project being conducted by a research team at Brown University,
            under the direction of Dr. Ellie Pavlick. We are interested in how people are able to reason quickly and
            in a commonsense way about the different scenarios that they encounter in the world around them. A
            better
            understanding of commonsense reasoning has implications for building more intelligent machines that can
            reason
            in a more human-like way, lowering risk in different physical situations. During this study, you will be
            presented with simple questions in text format.
        </p>
        <p class="jspsych-display-element" align=left>
            The study will last around 5 minutes. Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You may
            refuse
            to participate, or you may choose to withdraw from participation at any time, without penalty or loss of
            benefit
            to which you are otherwise entitled. There has been no harm to people involved in this study and there are
            no risks
            associated with participation.
        </p>
        <p class="jspsych-display-element" align=left>
            All information collected from the study will be associated with a Prolific Subject ID. Only researchers
            associated with this project will
            have access to the data. In order to make a research transparent to the scientific and broader community our
            study
            design and unidentifiable data might be made publicly available on Open Science Framework, a network of
            research
            materials and collaboration software, but your data will not be in anyway identifiable.
        </p>
        <p class="jspsych-display-element" align=left>
            We will also provide you with a demographic questionnaire. The form does not include any personal
            identifying
            information. Your contribution to this questionnaire is voluntary;
            if you choose to provide the requested information, your responses will be confidential. You will be
            reimbursed
            at a rate of $12/hr for your participation.
        </p>
        <p class="jspsych-display-element" style="display: inline;" align=left>
            Your participation in our study would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions about the project
            please
            feel free to contact us at the Language Understanding and Representation Laboratory at the Department of
            Computer Science,
